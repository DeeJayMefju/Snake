<h1>Snake v1.2</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
This game is my own implementation of very well known game from old mobile phones.<br>
It uses Java Swing to create graphics, threads to update game state, repaint graphics and generate bonus events.<br>
The game has three difficulty levels and allows to set walls and obstacles on/off. 
<h3>Bonuses</h3>
 <b>red apple</b> increases length by 1 and gives 1 score point.
- green apple - speeds up the snake for a few seconds<br>
- golden apple - works like three red apples<br>
- helmet - allows to break one obstacle, doesn't work for walls.<br>
